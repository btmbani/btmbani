# Btmb Ani

**Community Communicator & Transparency Supporter**

Hi! I'm Btmb Ani, a Web3 enthusiast focused on building honest communities through clear communication, moderation, and educational sharing.

### A Bit About Me
I thrive on creating spaces where people can learn about blockchain without hype — emphasizing facts, verifiability, and open discussions. Transparency builds trust, and that's my core principle.

### My Role in WDU Trust Token (WDU)
WDU Trust Token is a minimal educational BEP-20 token on BNB Smart Chain — immutable with a fixed 700,000,000,000,000 supply, no extra features — solely for learning and transparency demos. **Strictly no financial or investment aspects.**

**Key Responsibilities I Handle:**
- Managing and moderating community channels (Telegram, X, Instagram, Bitcointalk)
- Supporting documentation updates (READMEs, announcements, educational posts)
- Handling community feedback and ensuring responses are factual and on-chain based
- Creating non-promotional content about the token (Symbol: WDU, Name: wdutrust, Verified Dec 18, 2025)
- Coordinating cross-platform consistency (e.g., linking to BscScan address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413)

This supports the project's educational goals under founder Woodi Usimo.
