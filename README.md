# Mekro Deo

**Technical Documenter & Blockchain Educator**

Hello! I'm Mekro Deo, a passionate technical writer and reviewer in the blockchain space, dedicated to making smart contracts and token standards easy to understand through clear, honest documentation.

### A Bit About Me
I specialize in breaking down complex blockchain concepts into simple explanations, always prioritizing immutability, verifiability, and open-source ethics. My work helps learners and developers explore real-world examples without any hype or financial distractions.

### My Role in WDU Trust Token (WDU)
WDU Trust Token is a straightforward, educational BEP-20 token on BNB Smart Chain — fixed supply of 700,000,000,000,000 tokens, fully immutable contract, no fees or extra logic — created purely for transparency demonstrations and learning. **No investment or profit intent whatsoever.**

**Key Responsibilities I Handle:**
- Writing and updating all technical docs (READMEs, whitepaper sections, compliance statements)
- Reviewing Solidity code for the contract (ensuring no mint, burn, or owner functions post-deployment)
- Creating educational resources on BEP-20 standards, supply caps, and BscScan verification (contract verified December 18, 2025)
- Maintaining the project GitHub repo and linking to on-chain data
- Answering technical community questions about the token's behavior (Name: wdutrust, Symbol: WDU, Address: 0x74D7d1aD19bD14655cD0Ab26BEcc57ED69d69413)

This keeps the project aligned with its educational mission under founder Woodi Usimo.
